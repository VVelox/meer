These are a set of simple routines that allow Meer to write out "block lists"
to a MySQL/MariaDB database.  The list can then be consumed by other devices
(firewalls for example) as a "block list".  

blocklist.cgi
-------------

This is the web CGI that "sends" the block list to the "client".  As IP 
addresses are sent,  they are removed.  This routines URL is where you would
configured you device to get blocklist.  For example:

http://10.10.10.10/cgi-bin/blocklist.cgi?apikey=yourkeyhere

The API key is set in the blocklist.cgi routine.  This prevents unauthorized 
access to you block lists.

blocklist.sql		
-------------

SQL database/table for routines to use.  To setup, do this:

$ mysqladmin -u root -p create blocklist
$ mysql -u root -p blocklist < blocklist.sql

external-program-sql-blocklist
------------------------------

This is the routine that will be called by Meer's "external" processors.  This
needs to be fed "alert" data.
